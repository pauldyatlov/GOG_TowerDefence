Hello! This is my test task for GOG. A quick briefing:

    I developed a Tower Defence game where you need to kill enemies while they are walking to the destination point. You can do that using two damaging towers (arrow and mage) and blocking tower. Don't block the path since the blocking tower will be destroyed.

You can adjust waves/enemies/tower using this document:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XzKmJA1c0rrxZnimIyiGqLQIsys7uMFIIIGzrGO_UfM

For changes to apply you need to redownload and rebuild the game. Otherwise, downloading the information from Google docs on every startup can take some time.

    The game is much bigger in my mind. I tried to complete the game in a week so I did not implement about half of features I tried to develop. Such as:

    Make walls damaged on bullet collision
    Divide some enemies by parts on death
    Not instant tower placement/upgrade
    Draw a circle shooting distance on hovering the tower
    Detailed tooltip with information about tower (power, shooting distance, cooldown etc.)
    Music/sound effects.

    Since you are unfortunately don't answer my email I sent on Friday, I will not commit any change so you can know I made the game in a pure week.

    List of used assets: 
4.1. Graphics: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/16-bit-fantasy-sprite-set-45002 4.2. Google docs connection: https://github.com/kimsama/Unity-QuickSheet 
4.3. A*: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm

    Inclusion list: 5.1. Source code 5.2. Win build 5.3. Web build: https://darkcheg.itch.io/td

    Rough estimate = 7 days * 3-4 hours = 21 - 28 hours.

    Enjoy! Please send me e-mail about my submission. I think I will further develop the game eventually :)
